# Artificial Neural Netweorks and Deep Learning Competition
In this repository there can be found the *Jupyter Notebooks* used by me and my collegues to participate to the competition.

The competition was based on two different challenges:
- Image Classification
- Time Series Forecasting

## 1. Image Classification
**Goal:** build a multiclass classifier to correclty classify images of leaves according to their plant specie
